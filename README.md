Hamming Code Encoder/Decoder
=========================

Encodes binary data using the Hamming Code method, detects and corrects errors, and displays the original data, encoded data, and corrected data.

Features
--------

* Encode user-input binary data using the Hamming Code.
* Automatically detect and correct errors in encoded data.
* Introduce a random error in the encoded data to demonstrate error detection and correction.
* Display the original data, encoded data, encoded data with an error, and the corrected data.

Requirements
------------

* Python 3.x
* Tkinter (usually included with Python)
* Additional Python libraries: random, math

Usage
-----

* Clone or download the source code from this repository.
* Run the script using Python: `python hamming_code_gui.py`
* Enter a binary number (e.g., 1101) in the input field.
* Click the "Encode/Decode" button to see the Hamming Code process in action. The application will display the encoded data, introduce and display an error, detect and correct the error, and finally, decode the corrected data.
